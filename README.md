#### Note

* If you wanna build lfs to run in your machine/virtual you need to create partition for this lfs system and mount to /mnt/lfs directory.
* If you just wanna create the livecd iso, you can straight run these script without mount partition for lfs.
* By default this script build the lfs system in /mnt/lfs directory, so make sure you spare this directory for it.
* If you wanna include extra package to base system/livecd, create build script into lfs/pkgscripts directory using existing template, edit 02-lfs-base script, add your custom package name to 'EXTRA_PKGS' and re-run the script.
* By default all package built using '-O2 -march=x86-64 -pipe' for CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, all cores for 'MAKEFLAGS', edit lfs/pkg.conf if you wanna change it.
